# Nodes Module Starter Kit bids you welcome!

Before you get started writing your next Angular Module, you need to set up a few things:

- Come up with an awesome name for your module
- Rename the files in the `src/` folder to your awesome name
- Fill out the information in `package.json` and `bower.json` (name, description, etc.)
- Correct the references in `index.html` to the styles and scripts
- Create a repository for your module on Github

------

When you are ready to release your package to the world, run `grunt build` - this will copy the scss files, and concatinate the javascript files.

A more comprehensive guide for submitting your package to Bower is in the works.

### We also recommend doing your fellow developers a few favors:

- Write a guide on how to use your module in the `readme.md` file
- Write a few demo examples so people can see the intended use
- If you want to go all the way, make a Github Pages branch, this will give your module a little home on the web where you can host your demos
